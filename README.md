CMT316 Group Project: Object localisation CV4

Authors: Edward Parkinson, Iwan Munro, Lewis Hemming, Meghana Reddy Anugu, Shaoshi Sun & Sreekar Chittajallu

It is straightforward for people to locate objects in an image, but can you develop a system to learn to do this? 
Given an image, this project aims to find all the instances of relevant objects (as bounding boxes) with labels. 
 
Dataset available at: http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/index.html 
 
For object detection/localisation, the dataset is we used is: Predicting the bounding box and label of each object from the twenty target classes in the test image.
